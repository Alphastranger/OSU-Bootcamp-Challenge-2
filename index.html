            <p> My name is Joseph Flynn and I have been a coder for only a<br> couple of weeks. Right now I am still finding my feet and trying to figure out the basics like CSS.<br> Hopefully I can come back to this page at some point and make it really special.<br> Overhead you will see the navigation bar, which took a painstaking amount of time to get working right.<br> That's the thing with coding though: nothing ever goes the way you want it to.</p>
